# Filter UI
UI to Filter anything.

## Why?
- To remove garbage photos.
- To organize your video library.

## How?
Just open directory with your media-files and start filtering:
- `J` / `F` - move file to `dislike` / `like` directory.
- `Q` / `P` - rotate image.
- `D` / `K` - change video speed.
- `L` - undo last (dis)like.
